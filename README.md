# Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection
## Deep Learning (CNN)

The Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection dataset contains two types of data, tumorous and non-tumorous. The creator 
of the data set did not specify what types of tumors are present in the toumorus data, so all data with tumors can be 
treated as potentially the same.

In the data augmentations section we improved the variety in the population of our data and also attempted to correct
for any class imbalances in the data. In this section, we first crop and resize the data then we use a convolutional 
neural network to attempt to classify if an image is tumorous or non-tumorous.
